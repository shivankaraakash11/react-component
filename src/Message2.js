                <p> When discussing the move from fossil fuels to renewable energy, government documents and reports increasingly talk about a ‘just transition’—one that shares the cost and the benefit equitably with communities. However, such transitions take place on a continuum, and as a country, we already have a bad track record. In fact, when it comes to coal, dams, and power projects, we have many examples of precisely what an unjust transition looks like.</p>
